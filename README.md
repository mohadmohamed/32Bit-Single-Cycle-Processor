# 32Bit-Single-Cycle-Processor:


Description: This 32 bit single cycle processor was designed using Logisim. In our design, the program counter is updated in every clock cycle and appropriate instruction is fetched for the instruction memory. The instruction is processed in control unit and the output for the given inputs is generated and if needed written in the data memory. Control unit and the ALU control are the key elements of our circuit as they help us to work on the instruction. 3 types of the instructions (R â€“ I - J) are processed correctly thanks to control unit.

# Setup:

You can refer to the following resource for detailed information about the setup. Reference: Processor Design Project

Because this project requires Logisim software for hardware design, first we need to download it from the following link: [Logisim Software](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/)

Logisim is an educational graphical tool which provides basic components for designing and simulating logic circuits.

Then, please download the following jar file because Logisim will ask for this library in order to work properly: [ cs316.jar](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs316/2006fa/projects123/cs316.jar)
